# uWAVE_Arduino
Examples for working with uWAVE modems from Arduino boards  
  
* uWAVE_Example_1.ino - sets uWAVE modem to command mode, request device info, updates settings and   
  ambient data settings, after that request all possible remote data from another uWAVE modem
* uWAVE_Example_2.ino - simple terminal to communicate from another uWAVE modem in transparent channel mode
* uWAVE_Example_3.ino - VLBL base. Parses RMC sentence from GNSS receiver, requests remote modem, and sends own geolocation +
  remote data (depth etc.) and measured slant range to the static remote modem via RF module.
